## Summary

Three legal MatMul branches with equal vector-weight shapes satisfy the pass predicate but crash during node insertion.

## Steps to reproduce

1. Clone the public reproducer repository and enter this case:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Yuhx141/graph-optimizer-issue-reproducers.git
   cd graph-optimizer-issue-reproducers/onnxoptimizer/OPT-CRASH-001
   ```

2. Install the release dependencies listed in [`requirements.txt`](https://github.com/Yuhx141/graph-optimizer-issue-reproducers/blob/main/onnxoptimizer/requirements.txt), or run against the tested source build.
3. Run `python reproduce.py`.

The script validates the source model, runs the implicated pass, disables only that pass as a positive control, and runs a one-condition negative control. The complete readable reproducer is at https://github.com/Yuhx141/graph-optimizer-issue-reproducers/tree/main/onnxoptimizer/OPT-CRASH-001.

## Actual result

Optimization aborts with an insertAfter assertion; disabling fuse_qkv or using only two branches succeeds.

## Expected result

The pass should require a supported matrix-weight rank or decline the fusion without asserting.

## Why the source graph is legal

`source.onnx` passes `onnx.checker.check_model(..., full_check=True)` and strict ONNX shape inference. Its fixed input is in `input.json`, and it executes with ONNX Runtime graph optimizations disabled. Exact hashes are in `SHA256SUMS`.

## Pass attribution

The minimum pass is `fuse_qkv`. Disabling only that pass restores a valid graph with output exactly equal to the unoptimized source for this witness.

## One-condition control

`control.onnx` changes the critical condition while keeping the same operator family. It remains valid and exact after optimization; its input is `control-input.json`.

## Likely cause and source location

The predicate checks equal constant shapes but not the rank required by the synthesized Concat/MatMul/Split sequence. See [onnxoptimizer/passes/fuse_qkv.h#L27-L93](https://github.com/onnx/optimizer/blob/c8d77f3b8326297d7bfb851513079616f7219cdc/onnxoptimizer/passes/fuse_qkv.h#L27-L93).
