## Affected versions

- Latest stable release tested: `v1.30.0` (`f2c39fe2f838cf35ce7da92824f5a5e3ee6e88a7`)
- Default-branch build tested: `a11b4e593164c82f7ce95efce3693744103f8176`

## Summary

serializing the optimized IR3 model changes four initializer-backed graph inputs from defaulted constants into required runtime inputs.

The source model loads with optimizations disabled. Enabling graph optimization reproduces the failure on ONNX Runtime 1.30.0. Disabling only `ConstantSharing` removes the failure. A compiled 1.31 development wheel based on `a11b4e593164c82f7ce95efce3693744103f8176` reproduced the same root. The relevant implementation remains present at official main `96f73115c95968a3f31f2a110b33c164d847dda4`.

## Steps to reproduce

1. Clone the public reproducer and enter this case:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Yuhx141/graph-optimizer-issue-reproducers.git
   cd graph-optimizer-issue-reproducers/onnxruntime/ORT-SEM-010
   ```

2. Install the versions in [`requirements.txt`](https://github.com/Yuhx141/graph-optimizer-issue-reproducers/blob/main/onnxruntime/requirements.txt).
3. Run `python reproduce.py`.

The standalone script validates the source behavior, reproduces the optimized behavior, and disables the implicated transformer as a positive control. The readable reproducer is at https://github.com/Yuhx141/graph-optimizer-issue-reproducers/tree/main/onnxruntime/ORT-SEM-010.

## Expected result

The optimizer must preserve every public value, remaining consumer, graph interface and numerical result of the valid source model, or decline the rewrite.

## Actual result

serializing the optimized IR3 model changes four initializer-backed graph inputs from defaulted constants into required runtime inputs.

## Likely cause and source location

ReplaceInputsToUseSharedInitializer removes duplicate initialized tensors but leaves the legacy graph input entries; under IR<4 those entries were not runtime inputs until their initializer defaults were removed.

Relevant source locations:
