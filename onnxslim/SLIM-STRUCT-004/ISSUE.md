## Summary

A legal Shape with nonzero start followed by reverse Slice keeps the correct runtime values but receives invalid inferred metadata.

## Steps to reproduce

1. Clone the public reproducer repository and enter this case:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Yuhx141/graph-optimizer-issue-reproducers.git
   cd graph-optimizer-issue-reproducers/onnxslim/SLIM-STRUCT-004
   ```

2. Install the release dependencies listed in [`requirements.txt`](https://github.com/Yuhx141/graph-optimizer-issue-reproducers/blob/main/onnxslim/requirements.txt), or run against the tested source build.
3. Run `python reproduce.py`.

The script validates the source model, runs the implicated pass, disables only that pass as a positive control, and runs a one-condition negative control. The complete readable reproducer is at https://github.com/Yuhx141/graph-optimizer-issue-reproducers/tree/main/onnxslim/SLIM-STRUCT-004.

## Actual result

The optimized graph executes to [4,3] but strict shape inference rejects its recorded output shape.

## Expected result

Inferred output metadata must agree with strict ONNX shape inference and the two-element runtime output.

## Why the source graph is legal

`source.onnx` passes `onnx.checker.check_model(..., full_check=True)` and strict ONNX shape inference. Its fixed input is in `input.json`, and it executes with ONNX Runtime graph optimizations disabled. Exact hashes are in `SHA256SUMS`.

## Pass attribution

The minimum pass is `shape inference`. Disabling only that pass restores a valid graph with output exactly equal to the unoptimized source for this witness.

## One-condition control

`control.onnx` changes the critical condition while keeping the same operator family. It remains valid and exact after optimization; its input is `control-input.json`.

## Likely cause and source location

The Shape/Slice inference path applies Slice indices without consistently accounting for the already-trimmed Shape result. See [onnxslim/core/shape_inference/standard_ops/tensor/slice.py#L1-L160](https://github.com/inisis/OnnxSlim/blob/e877aedb25311c27abd044bbd9fae22d9a5ee69a/onnxslim/core/shape_inference/standard_ops/tensor/slice.py#L1-L160).
