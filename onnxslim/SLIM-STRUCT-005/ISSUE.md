## Summary

A legal Pad crop before Conv is fused by copying its negative pad width into the Conv pads attribute.

## Steps to reproduce

1. Clone the public reproducer repository and enter this case:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Yuhx141/graph-optimizer-issue-reproducers.git
   cd graph-optimizer-issue-reproducers/onnxslim/SLIM-STRUCT-005
   ```

2. Install the release dependencies listed in [`requirements.txt`](https://github.com/Yuhx141/graph-optimizer-issue-reproducers/blob/main/onnxslim/requirements.txt), or run against the tested source build.
3. Run `python reproduce.py`.

The script validates the source model, runs the implicated pass, disables only that pass as a positive control, and runs a one-condition negative control. The complete readable reproducer is at https://github.com/Yuhx141/graph-optimizer-issue-reproducers/tree/main/onnxslim/SLIM-STRUCT-005.

## Actual result

The target Conv has a negative pads value and fails checker and backend loading.

## Expected result

Negative Pad widths must not be represented as Conv padding; the fusion should be skipped or preserve the crop.

## Why the source graph is legal

`source.onnx` passes `onnx.checker.check_model(..., full_check=True)` and strict ONNX shape inference. Its fixed input is in `input.json`, and it executes with ONNX Runtime graph optimizations disabled. Exact hashes are in `SHA256SUMS`.

## Pass attribution

The minimum pass is `FusionPadConv`. Disabling only that pass restores a valid graph with output exactly equal to the unoptimized source for this witness.

## One-condition control

`control.onnx` changes the critical condition while keeping the same operator family. It remains valid and exact after optimization; its input is `control-input.json`.

## Likely cause and source location

The fusion accepts constant Pad widths without requiring every spatial width to be nonnegative. See [onnxslim/core/pattern/fusion/padconv.py#L25-L90](https://github.com/inisis/OnnxSlim/blob/e877aedb25311c27abd044bbd9fae22d9a5ee69a/onnxslim/core/pattern/fusion/padconv.py#L25-L90).
