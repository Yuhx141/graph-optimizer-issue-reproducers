## Summary

Consecutive Slice nodes using -1 and its equivalent nonnegative axis are combined into a Slice with duplicate axes.

## Steps to reproduce

1. Clone the public reproducer repository and enter this case:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Yuhx141/graph-optimizer-issue-reproducers.git
   cd graph-optimizer-issue-reproducers/onnxslim/SLIM-STRUCT-003
   ```

2. Install the release dependencies listed in [`requirements.txt`](https://github.com/Yuhx141/graph-optimizer-issue-reproducers/blob/main/onnxslim/requirements.txt), or run against the tested source build.
3. Run `python reproduce.py`.

The script validates the source model, runs the implicated pass, disables only that pass as a positive control, and runs a one-condition negative control. The complete readable reproducer is at https://github.com/Yuhx141/graph-optimizer-issue-reproducers/tree/main/onnxslim/SLIM-STRUCT-003.

## Actual result

The optimized Slice contains the same logical axis twice and fails ONNX validation.

## Expected result

Axes must be normalized before checking whether consecutive Slice operations overlap.

## Why the source graph is legal

`source.onnx` passes `onnx.checker.check_model(..., full_check=True)` and strict ONNX shape inference. Its fixed input is in `input.json`, and it executes with ONNX Runtime graph optimizations disabled. Exact hashes are in `SHA256SUMS`.

## Pass attribution

The minimum pass is `EliminationSlice`. Disabling only that pass restores a valid graph with output exactly equal to the unoptimized source for this witness.

## One-condition control

`control.onnx` changes the critical condition while keeping the same operator family. It remains valid and exact after optimization; its input is `control-input.json`.

## Likely cause and source location

The overlap check compares raw axis integers rather than normalized axes. See [onnxslim/core/pattern/elimination/slice.py#L33-L65](https://github.com/inisis/OnnxSlim/blob/e877aedb25311c27abd044bbd9fae22d9a5ee69a/onnxslim/core/pattern/elimination/slice.py#L33-L65).

## Duplicate search

Issue #277 added a raw duplicate-axis guard, but negative/nonnegative aliases still bypass it.

## Environment

Linux x86-64, CPython 3.11, ONNX 1.22.0, NumPy 2.4.6, ONNX Runtime 1.30.0, CPU execution provider. Full revision and build details are in [environment.json](https://github.com/Yuhx141/graph-optimizer-issue-reproducers/blob/main/environment.json).
